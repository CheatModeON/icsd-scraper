ICSD website Scrapper v.0000000001

## About
Scrapping professors and courses from http://www.icsd.aegean.gr/icsd/

Original idea by Yannis Alexiou. 
Check his implementation in NodeJS here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/icsd-scraper

## Usage
Run script "python PapaScrap.py"
It already includes examples of usages at the end of the code

## Functions
### getProfessors()
Returns all professors as an array of objects with the below details:
* name
* academicRank
* link
* office
* tel
* email
* website
* image
### getCourses()
Returns all courses as an array of objects with the below details:
* title
* code
* semester
* ects
* theoryHours
* labHours
* professor
* link
### getAdvancedCourses()
Returns all courses as an array of objects with the below details:
* title
* code
* semester
* ects
* theoryHours
* labHours
* professor
* link
* courseWebsite
* contentOutline
* learningOutcomes
* prerequisites
* basicTextbooks
* additionalReferences
* teachingMethod
* grandingMethod
* languageOfInstruction
* modeOfDelivery

**⚠️Ιmportant:** getAdvancedCourses doesn't always work properly due to lack of consistency of ICSD site. So it's better to use the getBasicCourses to retrieve basic course information.
